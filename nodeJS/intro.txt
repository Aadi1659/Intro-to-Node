NPM stands for node package manager and is currently the largest package manager for node.
We start of by writing a command called node init which will create the package.json file for our project.

to use npm external packages we need to install them into our project first.
its as simple as npm install <package>
make sure you are in the project directory.

for eg we will install the superheroes package.
const superheroes = require('superheroes');
var mySuperHero = superheroes.random();
console.log(mySuperHero);
